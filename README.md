Facial Expression Recognition with Keras and deployment using flume
- Develop a facial expression recognition model in Keras
- Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN)
- Deploy the trained model to a web interface with Flask
- Apply the model to real-time video streams and image data

# Applied to Videos and can be used on recorded videos also.
